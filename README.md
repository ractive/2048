# 2048
What do I need to say about 2048? I guess most of you already spent hours gaming it... ;-)
https://ractive.github.io/2048/

For the ones that don't know it yet:
- Use the gamepad to move the tiles into a direction, where they slide as far as possible
- If two tiles with the same number collide, they get combined into one tile with double the value
- A new tile with the value 2 (or less often 4) appears after every move at a random position on a free spot
- The goal is to create a tile with the value of 2048 (and more)
- If there are no more spots for new tiles and no tiles can be combines anymore, the game is lost

And here's some interesting info about the original game:
